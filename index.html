        <h1>Chapter 1: The Mine</h1>
        <p>
          Six billion dollars worth of copper have been dug from the rightly named <span class="marker" id="copper">Copper Mountain area</span>, just south of Princeton, B.C. in the last century. After a dormant period, rising prices spurred by Asian demand brought the mine back to life. But now who's in charge?</p>

          <span id="mining-district" class="marker">Vancouver</span> is the motherlode of mine financing. With Toronto, the city’s financial sector capitalizes three-fifths of the world's mines. It's here that the cash needed to fund B.C.’s next generation of big copper strikes – like <span id="galore">Galore Creek</span>, <span class="marker" id="kerr">Kerr-Sulphrets-Mitchell</span>, and <span id="schaft">Schaft Creek</span> – may eventually come. From here Pollon explores BC’s low-grade, high-risk copper casino...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 3: The Smelter</h1>
        <p>
          Raw copper from Copper Mountain is melted and refined at Japan's <span id="naoshima">Naoshima Island</span>. From the deck of a private ferry racing across the Seto inland sea from <span id="osaka">Osaka</span>, the island appears as a tower of yellow rock on the horizon, tipped in a lush emerald. If this were a James Bond movie, Naoshima would be the island lair of an arch-villain. </p>

        <p>It was a short hop for Christopher Pollon, and the metal he’s following, from Japan across the East China Sea to the factory city of <span id="kunshan">Kunshan, China</span>. There B.C. copper finds its way into components used to make popular electronics. The Shanghai suburb is trying to hold off competition from up-and-coming centres inland: <span id="yunnan">Yunnan</span>, <span id="chengdu">Chengdu</span> and <span id="chonqing">Chonqing</span>.

        <p>


    Back on this side of the Pacific, Christopher Pollon tracked what becomes of manufactured copper when its useful life is over. In B.C.'s Peace country, gas fields are generating plenty of scrap metal. Consolidated at <span id="abc">A.B.C. Recycling</span>, used copper competes head-to-head with virgin ore from mines like Alaska’s planned giant <span id="pebble">Pebble Mine</span>.         </p>

Back in the Lower Mainland, urbanites go through their cell phones in about a year; laptops in two or three. Christopher Pollon followed the stream of turned-in-for-recycling electronics to suburban Langley, where cell phones are collected for recycling at <span id="sims">Sims Canada</span>. Some of the copper ends up back at Naoshima island.    </p>

        <h1>Follow Christopher Pollon on The Copper Road</h1>

        <p>Forget gold. Copper is British Columbia's most lucrative mineral export. The red metal ends up in smart phones,  in cars, in plumbing and house wiring—as well as in  landfills. How does it get there? Tyee Contributing Editor  Christopher Pollon wanted to find out. So he set out on  the Copper Road—from B.C. to Asia and back.
